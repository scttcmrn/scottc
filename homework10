This petition asks the newly elected government of Canada to take action to end violence against aboriginal women in Canada. Signing the
petition brings attention to this problem and shows that Canadians want to see action taken and justice served for the victims of these
tragic crimes. Previous government(s) had done nothing to address this problem, but since it was a major election issue this year I hope
the new government can fulfill their promise to address this matter.

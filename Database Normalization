Normalization is a technique used to eliminate redundancy in databases. This is useful for shortening query time to improve performance, minimizing the amount of storage needed for a database, and reducing data conflicts or corruption. An example of how a database could have problems without normalization is when an entity, such as an employee's name and ID number, are repeated multiple times in multiple tables within a database. Say this employee gets married and changes their name. Now all instances of that name need to be changed, requiring extra time to complete the task, instead of changing just one name record that a normalized database might have. If that database were properly normalized, the employee's name would be recorded in a specific table for employee names tied to IDs and the name record could be changed throughout the whole system by only manipulating one record instead of many.

My crowdfunding campaign idea is to create a service in which I will provide advice and tutorials on how to purchase
computer components and peripherals, as well as how to assemble a fully functioning personal computer. This will be
targetted primarily at PC gamers who have never built a PC before or who need purchasing advice for their next build.

The client will be delivered a series of personalized, one-on-one sessions (perhaps via skype) where I will educate 
them on whatever they need to know about computer parts, the smart way to purcahse parts and how to assemble the
parts into a PC that suits their specific needs.

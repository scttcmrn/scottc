I propose the idea of a personal chiropractor machine that will perform chiropractic adjustments in the comfort of your home 
without the cost of regular chiropractic appointments or pesky human interaction.

Pledges will go toward R&D, construction, marketing, and my food and rent.

Backers will receive various bonuses depending on how much money they pledge.
  
  The first 100 backers who pledge $1000 will get the PRIVILEGE of beta testing the device to work out kinks (HA PUN) so the 
  final product doesn't cause spine or neck injuries!*
  
  Backers who pledge $500 will receive a nice little book of concept artwork that you totally can't google!**
  
  Backers who pledge $200 may submit concept designs of the machine that will go into the concept art book.***
  
  Backers who pledge $100 get a copy of the official soundtrack.****
  
  Backers who pledge under $100 are losers and get nothing.
  
  
Wow! This product will surely revolutionize your life!*****

So what are you waiting for? Whip out that credit card and pledge yourself to the machine!******
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  





































  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
* Any injuries or fatalities incurred during the beta test are the sole responsibility of the participant.
** Upon a full price purchase of finished product.
*** Not all submissions may be included in the art book. No Submission is guaranteed to appear in the art book. The book may
even contain no images at all.
**** While supplies last. A convenience fee of $500 applies and will be automatically charged to your credit card without 
notice or receipt.
***** Improvement of quality of life is not guaranteed with the use of this product.
****** Pledges are not guaranteed to be used to fund this project. There is no guarantee that I won't use your pledge money 
to disappear from the internet and run off to Italy to laze on the beach and eat lots of pasta.

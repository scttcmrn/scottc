Before starting this class I considered technology, from a consumer perspective, to be fairly secure and I didn't worry about any of the potential dangers that I now know I face when using technology like the internet or mobile devices. I worry for those who will buy, or will buy, IoT devices because I've read countless alarming articles about just how insecure many of these devices are. That, coupled with the fact that most consumers don't employ good security practices for their passwords, data, etc., has me wanting to educate those around me on what I've learned about staying secure in this rapidly changing world.

Also, I've learned a bit about how the world of programming works, and I've decided to take ITC 110 (even though programming isn't the direction I'm going in) next quarter as a required elective for my program of study. I'm going into networking, but I think having a basic understanding of programming will be beneficial to me in some way.
